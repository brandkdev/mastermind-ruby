Mastermind - a Code Breaking game. Written in Ruby.

If you are unfamiliary with Mastermind, here are the rules (from wikipedia):

1. 12 rounds will be played
2. One player is the codemaker, one is the codebreaker.
3. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs.
4. Duplicates are allowed, but blanks are not
5. The codebreaker has to guess the correct combination both in color and
   order in the given amount of time.
6. The codemaker places a black peg if the color and position is correct, 
   and a white peg if only the color is correct.
