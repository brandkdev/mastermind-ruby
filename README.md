Mastermind - a Code Breaking game. Written in Ruby.

If you are unfamiliary with Mastermind, here are the rules (for this version):

1. 12 rounds will be played
2. The human player decides whether they want to be the codemaker, or codebreaker
3. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. (if computer, this is random) (must be numbered 1-6)
4. Duplicates are allowed, but blanks are not
5. The codebreaker has to guess the correct combination both in number and order.
6. An "X" is placed for the amount of guesses that were in the correct order, and number. 
7. And "O" is placed for the amount of guesses that were correct in number only, but out of order.
   Note: if there are duplicates of the same number, no additional "O" will be given.
